    "As in the previous tutorial, we suppose you run a deep learning company that provides NLP expertise with two clients: Bob <sup>MD</sup> and Alice <sup>MD</sup>. For this tutorial, we assume each of them are physicians running their respective medical practices and have a database of private medical transcriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob and Alice have heard of the great services you provide and asked you to create a text classifier to help them automatically assign a medical specialty to each patient transcription.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data from both Bob's and Alice's datasets, you would be able to create a bigger dataset that you can use to train a better classifer. Because the nature of the data, you would normally not be allowed to do this because the data is private.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't reveal their data to any third party and you cannot move Bob's data to your company's machines. Same for Alice's. Each dataset is contrained to live on its owner's machine, and they cannot be mixed together to create a bigger dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you think about OpenMined, and their great library called PySyft that provides the possiblity to perform Federated Learning and Encrypted Computations. Without that, you will be able to train a single model on both datasets at the same time. and YOUR ARE RIGHT!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "As you new, text datasets cannot be consumed directly for training a neural training. You need to create numerical representations of each text review before PySyft can consume it. Text needs to be tokenized first, preprocessed and vector embedding should be used instead of plaintext. But how to do such preprocessing if you are not allowed to have access to plaintext data? \n",
    "\n",
    "**SyferText** can help you! With SyferText, you can define preprocessing components that you can send over a network to Bob's and Alice's machine to perform preprocessing remotely, blindly and in a completely secure fashion. SyferText components do all the work from processing plaintext to obtaining its vector representation and encrypting it to hand it over to PySyft models for training. All without you accessing the data, and without the data quitting their owners machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are wondering how that works, keep on following this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's summarize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to create a bigger dataset out of Bob's and Alice's smaller datasets. *(PySyft has the arsenal for that)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You need to prepare and preprocess the text data on Bob's and Alice's machines without revealing it, without moving any datasets to your machine, and without the need to work directly on Bob's or Alice's machines. *(SyferText to the rescue)*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we are going to work with a medical transcriptions sample dataset. Which is a simulated dataset and a public dataset. For this tutorial, we are going to perform exploratory analysis and feature engineering to prepare the data to analysis. Then, we are going to break the data into two parts, send each part to a differet PySyft worker and then train the model."
